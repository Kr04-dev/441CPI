1. Do you have any previous programming experience? If so, what language(s)? If not, what are your initial
thoughts about the C language and this course?

	I have Programming experience of 2 years of JAVA in Highschool and overall as of now I think 
	C language is much more simpler then JAVA.

2. Describe your understanding of the compiling process of turning a C text file into an executable program.

	Compilation: This step takes the C source code, processes it, and converts it into machine code.
	It involves preprocessing (#include, #define), converting to assembly language, and finally,
	converting assembly language to machine code to create an object file.

	Linking: The object file created in the compilation step are combined with necessary libraries 
	to create a single executable file. This file is what you run on your computer to execute your
	program.

3. What do you hope to achieve in this course? Describe your goals and expectations.

	I hope to learn how header files and functions work by the end of this course.
